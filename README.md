# Code Hub Treasure

## Introduction
A repository to store all of my written code. 

Some of them are basic code that I wrote when I was a beginner, the others are piece of code that I write when I have free time or need to automatically do some small tasks. 

Some of them may be useful in the future, some may not. 

## Why do I store it?
Well, I think it's more like a personal interest. Maybe one day, I will go back, check out them, and see how I started in this journey. These are like the toys in my treasure box.
